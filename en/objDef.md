# ðŸ§¾ Object definitions

For more complex plugin work, it is sometimes necessary to define support objects. Some plugins encapsulate common application elements (e.g., UI components or JavaScript event handling), but this may not cover all scenarios.

This chapter therefore describes the [available object types][OEGroups] and how to define them so that they can be automatically indexed in the [object explorer][oexplorer].
