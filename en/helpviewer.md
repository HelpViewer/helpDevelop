## Version publishing

- Versions are released irregularly
- The version number is always the date of the release in yearmonthday format (for example: 20250621)
- If more than one version is released on a given day, then the first version has the format yearmonth and each subsequent version has the suffix **-number** starting from 1 with step 1, for example: 20250606-1, 20250606-2
- The data for describing version changes is obtained from **CHANGELOG.md** in the root of the repository. The description for the latest version is always appended to the beginning of the file. The oldest versions tend to be lowest in the listing. Do not change or remove the last section with ‚Äú**File introduced**‚Äù - it is also for your information
- This procedure applies to **HelpViewer** as well as other tools and issued help
- The same procedure is also recommended for authors of help files, although they are free to decide this point on their own
