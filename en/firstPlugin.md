# 🧩 First plugin

## Plugin creation process

To develop a new plugin, you need to do the following:

1. Define exactly what the plugin should do. Choose a parent for the plugin (**extends**) that is suitable for the given purpose. The content of the plugin will at least correspond to the minimum plugin - **IPlugin**.

### Help package

If you want to add the plugin to the help, then:

2. Create the following files in the help repository in the **_base** directory:
   - **plugins.lst** (list of plugins),
   - **plugins** and **plugins-config** directories

and then proceed according to the **Program package** chapter.

### Program package

If you want to add the plugin to the HelpViewer build:

3. Add the plugin to the [plugins list] with a definition line: 
   - **[class name]** if the plugin is only to be loaded (it is a parent for other plugins, but is not intended to work independently)
   - **[class name]:[instance name]** if the plugin is to be loaded and is intended to provide functionality
4. Place the configuration definitions for the new instance in **zip/plugins-config/[class name]_[instance name].cfg**.
5. Place the plugin source code in the location **zip/plugins/[class name].js**.

For help, use the location without **zip/**.

## Minimum plugin

```javascript
class pMinPlugin extends IPlugin {
  constructor(aliasName, data) {
    super(aliasName, data);
  }

  init() {
    //const T = this.constructor;
    //const TI = this;
    
    super.init();
  }

  deInit() {
    super.deInit();
  }
}

Plugins.catalogize(pMinPlugin);

```

- Calling **Plugins.catalogize(pMinPlugin);** is mandatory because it adds the plugin to the catalog of loaded plugins. Subsequently, based on the plugin name, it is possible to request its instance. Based on the data in **plugins.lst**, the application does this itself.
- Calling **super.** should be the first in the constructor and the last in init and deinit. They ensure the application of general common logic.
- const T and TI are abbreviations for accessing this and the class. This is a recommended writing concept across the system.
- If you only have a super. call in a function, you can remove the function entirely. Here in the example, everything is listed for a quick general overview.
