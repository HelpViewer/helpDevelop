# ðŸ‘‚ Event handler

The handler defines the system's response to a specific event.

If you have âš¡ [defined the event with a handler][eventWH], this procedure no longer makes sense for you within a single plugin.

## Definition

1. Define the function inside another plugin:

```javascript
  onET_ClickHandlerRegister(evt) {
  }
```

- evt will contain an instance of the **ClickHandlerRegister** class with event data.

## Meaning of the function name

- onET_ClickHandlerRegister (underscore) - receives **ClickHandlerRegister** events for any plugin id, even if ðŸ”º [filtering][filter] is defined.
- onETClickHandlerRegister - receives **ClickHandlerRegister** events with [id][IEvent-ID] that matches **plugin.aliasName**. The id '' is also considered a match in this method.
